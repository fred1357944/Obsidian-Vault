        "Description": "Quori\n-\n\nDal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. Il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmares — the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The Inspired are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.\n\n**Kalaraq Quori**\n\nThe most powerful quori are the kalaraqs, also known as eyebinders — entities formed of pure shadow that is outlined by a nimbus of energy. A host of disembodied eyes whirl around a kalaraq, each reflecting a consciousness the creature has consumed.\n\nKalaraq quori guide the quori race, and the Devourer of Dreams — the personal emissary of the Dreaming Dark — is of this order. Although the kalaraqs never fight one another overtly, each has its own agenda, and each hopes to someday seize the throne of the Devourer of Dreams. Because of this internal conflict, it is unusual for a kalaraq to leave Dal Quor to inhabit a mortal vessel and become one of the Inspired.",

The Inspired are the mortal hosts of the nightmare spirits of Dal Quor, and they carry out the foul agenda of the Dreaming Dark.\n\nAny humanoid who can dream can volunteer to serve as a quori vessel. But the Inspired of Sarlona are humans bred to be such vessels. They have no choice in this destiny, since they can’t resist quori possession. Physically, Inspired resemble the kalashtar, possessing an almost supernatural beauty.\n\nMost of the people of the Five Nations have heard of the Inspired lords in Riedra — never realizing that Inspired are spread throughout Khorvaire as well. Beggars and generals, mayors and merchants might all be secret servants of the Dreaming Dark. Such Inspired have to willingly accept quori possession, but the Dreaming Dark has long experience in weaving dreams that can convince mortals to surrender their bodies.\n\n**VARIANT: QUORI VESSEL**\n\nThe Inspired are vessels for quori spirits, allowing the quori to manifest a portion of their power while the vessel is possessed. An Inspired can gain benefits depending on the type of quori possessing it. The quori also gains access to the Inspired’s knowledge and features.\n\n**Hashalaq**\n\nSuggestion (3/Day).

A chef might use prestidigitation to heat and season food, while a blacksmith uses mending to perform minor repairs and guidance to help inspire their work. Those who work minor magic into their labors are called magewrights.\n\nFar more limited in magical power than a typical spellcaster, a magewright is dedicated to learning a handful of spells, and magewrights cast their non-cantrip spells as rituals — even spells that can’t normally be cast in this way. Most magewright rituals take 10 minutes to perform, but certain complex rituals can take up to 1 hour. However long the ritual takes, it requires extra material components, usually in the form of dragonshards.\n\n**Creating a Magewright**\n\nThe magewright stat block provides the baseline statistics for a magewright. You then add to that baseline by choosing a specialty from the Magewright Specialties table, or roll for one. The specialty determines additional spells the magewright knows, including ones that can be cast only as rituals. The specialty also gives the magewright more proficiencies.\n\n***Magewright Specialties***\n\n\n\n\n**d\u00008**\n\n**Specialty**\n\n**Spells**\n\n**Proficiencies**\n\n\n\n\n***1***\n\n*Artisan*\n\n*Guidance, mending*\n\n*One type of artisan's tools*\n\n\n***2***\n\n*Entertainer*\n\n*Minor illusion, thaumaturgy.

But the Inspired of Sarlona are humans bred to be such vessels. They have no choice in this destiny, since they can’t resist quori possession. Physically, Inspired resemble the kalashtar, possessing an almost supernatural beauty.\n\nMost of the people of the Five Nations have heard of the Inspired lords in Riedra — never realizing that Inspired are spread throughout Khorvaire as well. Beggars and generals, mayors and merchants might all be secret servants of the Dreaming Dark. Such Inspired have to willingly accept quori possession, but the Dreaming Dark has long experience in weaving dreams that can convince mortals to surrender their bodies.\n\n**VARIANT: QUORI VESSEL**\n\nThe Inspired are vessels for quori spirits, allowing the quori to manifest a portion of their power while the vessel is possessed. An Inspired can gain benefits depending on the type of quori possessing it. The quori also gains access to the Inspired’s knowledge and features.\n\n**Hashalaq**\n\nSuggestion (3/Day).

        "Description": "Radiant Idol\n-\n\nA radiant idol was an angel that was banished from the celestial realm of Syrania and cast down to the Material Plane. One sin led to their fall: the desire to be worshiped by mortals. Now in the mortal realm, most radiant idols gather cults of devoted followers.\n\n**Fallen Angels**. The insatiable hunger to be adored can transform a fallen angel, physically and mentally. In its true form, a radiant idol appears to be a warped angel. It might have bloody stumps in place of its wings, or its wings could be weighted down with chains representing its pride. A radiant idol uses disguise self to hide its corruption, presenting an image of celestial glory.\n\n**The Weight of Corruption**. When a radiant idol achieves a sizable following through silvered words and demonstrations of power, its facade begins to crack, and a downward spiral ensues. As the radiant idol sinks deeper into the realm of material power, it begins twisting its followers, leading them ever deeper into ominous ritualism, hedonistic folly, and fanatical doom.\n\n**Immortal Nature**. A radiant idol doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.",

        "Description": "Kenku\n-\n\nKenku are feathered humanoids that wander the world as vagabonds, driven by greed. They can perfectly imitate any sound they hear.\n\n**Fallen Flocks**. Kenku wear ill-fitting cloaks, robes, and rags. These garments cover the soft, sleek feathers of their bodies, shrouding their bare arms and legs. They tread lightly when they walk, on talons made for grasping the branches of trees and seizing prey from the lofty skies. Soft as the wind they move, so as not to draw attention to their shameful forms.\n\nOnce, the kenku held the wind in their wings, embracing the gusty sky and singing the sweet language of birdsong. Serving a master whose identity is now lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering baubles of his household, and longed to speak so that they could cajole and swindle others out of such treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volume in their master’s library, they disguised themselves in rags to beg for pretty things. When their master learned of their greed, he stripped away their wings as punishment, forcing them to beg forever.\n\n**Speech in Pantomime**. Kenku can mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might make the sound of coins clinking together, and a kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs, bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. To converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of imitated sounds and almost nonsensical verse.\n\nKenku speak to one another in much the same way. Because they are adept at interpreting one another’s glances and gestures, the sounds they make to communicate complex ideas or emotions can be succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secret codes. For example, a cat’s meow might be the secret code for “Prepare to attack!” or “Flee for your lives!”\n\nTheir talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge documents. When a kenku commits a crime, it might forge evidence to implicate another creature.\n\n**The Wistful Wingless**. All kenku pine for the ability to fly, and thus the punishments they mete out to one another often involve false wings, such as heavy wings of wood borne as a mark of shame. As a final, tragic reminder of the wings they once had, kenku carry out executions by hurling their condemned from tall buildings or cliffs.",

        "Description": "Lady Illmarrow\n-\n\nLady Illmarrow is a legend — an ancient lich said to dwell in a castle of bone and ice in the coldest regions of the Lhazaar Principalities. Some stories say that she is served by a legion of undead and that she maintains a court of vampires and ghosts in her palace of ice. Other tales claim that when anyone dies in Lhazaar, Illmarrow chooses whether to take their soul before it passes on to the Keeper and Dolurrh.\n\nBut Lady Illmarrow is no folk tale. She is the greatest necromancer in Eberron, and after centuries of silence, she is setting ancient plots into motion at last. She is the power behind the Order of the Emerald Claw, but her motives for founding the order are buried in her past. Lady Illmarrow has no interest in ruling the living. Rather, she seeks to become Queen of the Dead.\n\n**The Mark of Death**. Illmarrow is a fiefdom on the isle of Farlnen — home to a community of elves exiled from Aerenal, who have practiced necromancy for centuries. But Lady Illmarrow’s roots extend far beyond her island domain.\n\nLong ago, it was revealed that the elven line of Vol — a house that practiced the art of necromancy and bore the Dragonmark of Death — was engaged in secret blood rites with a clan of dragons. The discovery of this pact triggered an unprecedented alliance between the Sibling Kings of Aerenal and the dragons of Argonnessen. The Sibling Kings proclaimed that House Vol would be exterminated to the last member, and the Mark of Death would be eliminated from the world.\n\nThe line of Vol had long been rivals of the Undying Court, and many whisper even today that the attack on House Vol was nothing more than an excuse to eliminate a political rival. But others believe that what the Undying Court truly feared was a path shown in the Draconic Prophecy — that a child born of dragon and elf could become a godlike avatar of death.\n\n**Illmarrow Rises**. Even as dragons and elves fought to destroy the line of Vol, a child was born to the house: Erandis. A scion of elf and dragon, Erandis bore a Mark of Death unlike any other. In time, it might have been her gateway to immortality and unrivaled power, but she was hunted down and killed long before she could master the mark’s magic. Her mother, Minara Vol, escaped with her daughter’s body to the icy reaches of Farlnen, far from the conflict. There, Minara unleashed all her necromantic power to raise Erandis as a lich.\n\nAs an undead being, Erandis lost the use of her dragonmark. Thus, when the diviners of Aerenal asked if the line of Vol had been exterminated and the Mark of Death destroyed, they received a vision affirming that the bloodline of Vol was no more. To the world, the last survivor of that bloodline is known as Lady Illmarrow. But in truth, she is Erandis Vol, heir to the Mark of Death.\n\n**Trapped in Undeath**. When Minara restored Erandis as a lich, she hid her daughter’s phylactery, weaving enchantments into it that cause Erandis to be reborn in a random safe haven after she is destroyed. Thus, even Erandis herself doesn’t know the location or form of her phylactery.\n\n**Restoring the Mark**. Though she takes great pleasure in fighting the dragons and elves who destroyed her ancestors, Lady Illmarrow has a more important goal: restoring her dragonmark and unlocking godlike powers. The agents of the Emerald Claw who serve her fight either for the good of Karrnath or for personal gain, but Illmarrow cares for nothing except increasing her necromantic knowledge and finding a way to restore her lost mark.\n\n***LADY ILLMARROW AND THE BLOOD OF VOL***\n\nThe Blood of Vol and Lady Illmarrow are both legacies of the line of Vol, but they aren’t one and the same. As far as the world knows, the line of Vol was exterminated. Followers of the Blood of Vol who have heard of Lady Illmarrow believe that she’s a champion of their faith, but they don’t worship or serve her. And the powers of priests of the Blood of Vol don’t come from Lady Illmarrow.",

        "Description": "Valenar Hound\n-\n\nThe elves of Valenar say that when their ancestors fought the giants of Xen’drik, elf druids took the forms of animals on the battlefield. The cruel and mighty Emperor Cul’sir of the giants laid a curse upon the druids and trapped them in the forms of animals. Just as the ancestors of the Valenar guide their warriors in battle, the spirits of these druids can awaken power in an animal to create a companion worthy of a champion.\n\nValenar animals are awakened to advanced intelligence and power by the touch of an ancestral spirit. Traditionally, Valenar animals choose Valenar elves as companions, reflecting a bond between the ancestors of elf and animal. To be chosen by a Valenar animal is a great honor, and any such elf is treated with respect and reverence. Still, on the rare occasions when a Valenar animal chooses an adventurer of a different ancestry as a companion, it is universally accepted.\n\nVariant: Ancestral Traits\n-\n\nEach Valenar animal can be customized with an ancestral gift, a supernatural trait granted by its ancestral spirit. Choose a trait or roll on the Ancestral Traits table for each Valenar animal.\n\n***Ancestral Traits***\n\n\n\n**d8**\n\n**Trait**\n\n\n\n\n***1***\n\n*Bestow Luck (1/Day).

        "Description": "Undying Soldier\n-\n\nUndying soldiers make up the army of Aerenal’s City of the Dead. They guard the temples of the Undying Court and the mansions of the noble lines of Aerenal, and Aereni ambassadors are often accompanied by undead bodyguards. Undying soldiers wear heirloom armor and wield ornate weaponry.\n\n-\n\nThe Undying\n-\n\nThe undying are undead creatures sustained by positive energy or the devotion of mortal beings. Where strong negative emotions can trap a spirit as a ghost or wraith, the undying are spirits who linger because they are cherished and who in turn seek to protect and guide the people of their community.\n\nThough it’s possible for undying to appear anywhere, it is rare for them to manifest naturally. The only place where they are found in significant numbers is the island of Aerenal, a land whose close ties to the plane of Irian suffuse it with positive energy. The elves of Aerenal spent thousands of years working to develop rituals that tap into this energy, allowing them to preserve their greatest citizens as undying.\n\n**The Face of Death**. The light of Irian sustains the spirit, but it doesn’t preserve the physical body. The undying appear as desiccated corpses, their flesh withering away over centuries. At the same time, the spirit of the undying surrounds the body — an aura of light forming a spectral shadow of the soul. The light shed by an undying doesn’t generate heat, but it provides a sense of warmth and comfort.\n\nThe most powerful of the undying can separate their spirits from their physical forms, existing as beings of pure light. This state is the ultimate goal of the elves of Aerenal, and such beings are known as ascendant councilors.\n\n**Bound by Love and Light**. Undying are sustained by positive energy, whether found in manifest zones tied to Irian — such as in Shae Mordai, the Aereni City of the Dead — or freely given by the devotion of mortal beings. The worship of the Undying Court is what sustains the undying of Aerenal, but devotion is a finite resource. As such, each elf that becomes an undying must earn their afterlife. If an undying elf leaves Aerenal, they require a community of elves or another source of positive energy to sustain them. Failing this, their light fades and they eventually die.\n\n**The Undying Court**. The honored undead of Aerenal are united in the Undying Court. Based in the city of Shae Mordai, the members of the Undying Court spend their time meditating, engaging in research, or continuing to perfect the arts they practiced in life. They serve as guides and advisors to the living, and members of the noble lines of Aerenal can exercise the rite of counsel to consult with ancestors in Shae Mordai.\n\nThe greatest members of the Undying Court are the ascendant councilors. These beings of pure light are focused on contemplating the mysteries of life and the planes, and can work together to wield godlike power that allows them to shield Aerenal from almost any threat. However, the ascendant councilors can exercise power beyond Aerenal only by acting through devoted mortals — paladins and clerics of the Undying Court.\n\n**Undead Nature**. An undying doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Living spells most often manifest from evocation and conjuration spells. To make a living spell from a different spell, choose a damage-dealing evocation or conjuration spell from the wizard spell list of up to 5th level. Then consult the Living Spell Customization table to see which stat block to customize, based on the chosen spell’s level.\n\n***Living Spell Customization***\n\n\n\n**Spell Level**\n\n**Stat Block to Customize**\n\n\n\n\n***1–2***\n\n*Living burning hands*\n\n\n***3–4***\n\n*Living lightning bolt*\n\n\n***5***\n\n*Living cloudkill*\n\n\n\nNow make the following changes to that stat block:\n\n**Damage Immunity**. Replace the living spell’s damage immunity with immunity to the type (or types) of damage dealt by the chosen spell.\n\n**Magical Strike**. Replace the damage that Magical Strike deals with one type of damage dealt by the chosen spell.\n\n**Spell Mimicry**. Replace the effect of Spell Mimicry with the effect of the chosen spell. If that spell requires a saving throw, use spell save DC from the replaced spell, and if the spell involves an attack roll, use the attack bonus from the living spell’s Magical Strike.\n\nFor example, if you turn fireball (a 3rd-level spell) into a living spell, customize the living lightning bolt. The living fireball has immunity to fire damage, instead of lightning damage; deals fire damage with its Magical Strike; and replicates fireball with Spell Mimicry.",

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Dyrrn can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n•Dyrrn uses its Corruption action.\n\n•A 30-foot-square area of ground within 120 feet of Dyrrn sprouts tentacles until initiative count 20 on the next round. Any creature that starts or ends its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be restrained. A creature can escape the tentacles with a successful DC 23 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check as an action.\n\n•Each creature of Dyrrn’s choice that it can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (4d12) psychic damage. Unless the target has immunity to psychic damage, its Intelligence score is reduced by 1d4 each time it fails the saving throw for this lair action. The target dies if its Intelligence score is reduced to 0. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.\n\nRegional Effects\n-\n\nA region containing a passage to Dyrrn’s lair is warped in one or more of these ways:\n\n•Plants and animals raised within 2 mile of the passage have twisted, aberrant forms. Use the Daelkyr Modifications table for inspiration.\n\n•Creatures within 1 mile of the passage frequently feel as if something is crawling under their skin.\n\n•If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the passage, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a type of madness (see “Madness of Dyrrn” below).

They are the most powerful members of the Undying Court who still maintain their physical forms. While many undying councilors spend their days advising the living, some devote years projecting their consciousness into the Astral Plane, seeking new knowledge to share with their people. Still, not all minds are capable of assimilating immortality, and undying councilors sometimes buckle under the strain and go mad.\n\n-\n\nThe Undying\n-\n\nThe undying are undead creatures sustained by positive energy or the devotion of mortal beings. Where strong negative emotions can trap a spirit as a ghost or wraith, the undying are spirits who linger because they are cherished and who in turn seek to protect and guide the people of their community.\n\nThough it’s possible for undying to appear anywhere, it is rare for them to manifest naturally. The only place where they are found in significant numbers is the island of Aerenal, a land whose close ties to the plane of Irian suffuse it with positive energy. The elves of Aerenal spent thousands of years working to develop rituals that tap into this energy, allowing them to preserve their greatest citizens as undying.\n\n**The Face of Death**. The light of Irian sustains the spirit, but it doesn’t preserve the physical body. The undying appear as desiccated corpses, their flesh withering away over centuries. At the same time, the spirit of the undying surrounds the body — an aura of light forming a spectral shadow of the soul. The light shed by an undying doesn’t generate heat, but it provides a sense of warmth and comfort.\n\nThe most powerful of the undying can separate their spirits from their physical forms, existing as beings of pure light. This state is the ultimate goal of the elves of Aerenal, and such beings are known as ascendant councilors.\n\n**Bound by Love and Light**. Undying are sustained by positive energy, whether found in manifest zones tied to Irian — such as in Shae Mordai, the Aereni City of the Dead — or freely given by the devotion of mortal beings. The worship of the Undying Court is what sustains the undying of Aerenal, but devotion is a finite resource. As such, each elf that becomes an undying must earn their afterlife. If an undying elf leaves Aerenal, they require a community of elves or another source of positive energy to sustain them. Failing this, their light fades and they eventually die.\n\n**The Undying Court**. The honored undead of Aerenal are united in the Undying Court. Based in the city of Shae Mordai, the members of the Undying Court spend their time meditating, engaging in research, or continuing to perfect the arts they practiced in life. They serve as guides and advisors to the living, and members of the noble lines of Aerenal can exercise the rite of counsel to consult with ancestors in Shae Mordai.\n\nThe greatest members of the Undying Court are the ascendant councilors. These beings of pure light are focused on contemplating the mysteries of life and the planes, and can work together to wield godlike power that allows them to shield Aerenal from almost any threat. However, the ascendant councilors can exercise power beyond Aerenal only by acting through devoted mortals — paladins and clerics of the Undying Court.\n\n**Undead Nature**. An undying doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

        "Description": "Quori\n-\n\nDal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. Il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmares — the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The Inspired are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.\n\nTsucora Quori\n-\n\nTsucora quori are nightmarish creatures. Their headless torsos are covered with eyes and twitching limbs, including two massive arms that end in powerful pincers, and a serpentine tail tipped with a vicious stinger. They are cruel and calculating, enjoying the power they wield over others as they concoct elaborate schemes to advance their own positions and discredit their rivals.\n\n**Relentless Schemers**. Constantly jockeying for position, each tsucora hopes to be reincarnated as a more powerful servant of the Dreaming Dark. As such, their plans are as often focused on the ruination of competitors as they are on the furthering of il-Lashtavar’s plans. When they aren’t serving in the cities of their nightmare realm, they hunt the dreaming spirits of mortals.\n\n**Fearmongers**. Their ability to manipulate the fears of mortals sees tsucoras often sent to Eberron as Inspired. Nothing keeps humanoid chattel in line like fear, and the tsucoras are the masters of manipulating the uncertainty of mobs and high-ranking officials alike. The effectiveness of tsucora Inspired keeps the members of this order in the good graces of the kalaraq quori.",

The Inspired are the mortal hosts of the nightmare spirits of Dal Quor, and they carry out the foul agenda of the Dreaming Dark.\n\nAny humanoid who can dream can volunteer to serve as a quori vessel. But the Inspired of Sarlona are humans bred to be such vessels. They have no choice in this destiny, since they can’t resist quori possession. Physically, Inspired resemble the kalashtar, possessing an almost supernatural beauty.\n\nMost of the people of the Five Nations have heard of the Inspired lords in Riedra — never realizing that Inspired are spread throughout Khorvaire as well. Beggars and generals, mayors and merchants might all be secret servants of the Dreaming Dark. Such Inspired have to willingly accept quori possession, but the Dreaming Dark has long experience in weaving dreams that can convince mortals to surrender their bodies.\n\n**VARIANT: QUORI VESSEL**\n\nThe Inspired are vessels for quori spirits, allowing the quori to manifest a portion of their power while the vessel is possessed. An Inspired can gain benefits depending on the type of quori possessing it. The quori also gains access to the Inspired’s knowledge and features.\n\n**Hashalaq**\n\nSuggestion (3/Day).

These noble families are said to be bound to celestial spirits that guide and empower them, but the truth is far darker. The Inspired are the mortal hosts of the nightmare spirits of Dal Quor, and they carry out the foul agenda of the Dreaming Dark.\n\nAny humanoid who can dream can volunteer to serve as a quori vessel. But the Inspired of Sarlona are humans bred to be such vessels. They have no choice in this destiny, since they can’t resist quori possession. Physically, Inspired resemble the kalashtar, possessing an almost supernatural beauty.\n\nMost of the people of the Five Nations have heard of the Inspired lords in Riedra — never realizing that Inspired are spread throughout Khorvaire as well. Beggars and generals, mayors and merchants might all be secret servants of the Dreaming Dark. Such Inspired have to willingly accept quori possession, but the Dreaming Dark has long experience in weaving dreams that can convince mortals to surrender their bodies.\n\n**VARIANT: QUORI VESSEL**\n\nThe Inspired are vessels for quori spirits, allowing the quori to manifest a portion of their power while the vessel is possessed. An Inspired can gain benefits depending on the type of quori possessing it. The quori also gains access to the Inspired’s knowledge and features.\n\n**Hashalaq**\n\nSuggestion (3/Day). The Inspired can cast the suggestion spell (spell save DC 13), requiring no material components.\n\n**Kalaraq**\n\nAll Around Vision. The Inspired can’t be surprised.\n\nArcane Eye (3/Day). The Inspired can cast the arcane eye spell, requiring no material components.\n\n**Tsucora**\n\nFear (1/Day).

In the Age of Giants, giant artificers built mindless war golems to aid them in their war against the quori. Millennia later, some of these golems were unearthed by adventurers searching for the secrets of that age, then turned over to artificers working for the dragonmarked houses during the Last War.

Dyrrn the Corruptor shaped dolgaunts from hobgoblin stock, turning them into intelligent, cold, and efficient killers.\n\nWhen the daelkyr were defeated, the dolgaunts descended into the depths of Khyber with their masters. There, they study in cavernous monasteries, forging their bodies into living weapons dedicated to the missions given them by those masters.

        "Description": "Warforged Colossus\n-\n\nIn the final days of the Last War, House Cannith unleashed its mightiest creations: the warforged colossi. These enormous mechanical warriors thundered across Cyre, crushing everything in their paths and leaving ruin behind them. Meant to end the war decisively, the colossi pulverized hundreds of soldiers beneath their feet and incinerated whole legions with beams of fiery light that shot from their mouths. This rampage was cut short on the Day of Mourning. The arcane cataclysm that engulfed Cyre destroyed most of the warforged colossi, causing them to collapse into lifeless heaps.\n\n**Colossal Survivors**. Some warforged colossi survived the Day of Mourning more or less intact and are thought to only be in stasis, waiting to be awakened. Cannith artificers are eager to track them down and determine whether they can be awakened or, at the very least, salvaged for docents and other magic items. Here are locations where operational warforged colossi are rumored to dwell:\n\n• “Arkus” (Colossus WX-11) lies prone at the bottom of the Glowing Chasm in the northern part of the Mournland, with one of its arms torn off.\n\n• “Artorok” (Colossus WX-73) sits at the bottom of Lake Cyre amid the scaffolding of a sunken House Cannith workshop, flooded but otherwise intact.\n\n• “Hanamar” (Colossus WX-42) stands at the bottom of Kraken Bay, near the coast of Valenar, buried up to its knees in sand and flooded, but it is otherwise intact.\n\n•“Karrnslayer” (Colossus WX-31) lost its legs but crawls through the Mournland, using its arms to drag its great bulk across the ground. It is always prone and can’t use its Stomp action, but makes three extra turret attacks when it takes the Multiattack action option.\n\n• “Landro” (Colossus WX-33) is partially phased into a mountainside on the border of Cyre and Breland, but still explorable and potentially salvageable.\n\n• “Norr” (Colossus WX-5) is slumped amid the ruins of Metrol, the former capital of Cyre.\n\n• “Tymber” (Colossus WX-12) squats in the Crawling Swamp, in the northwest corner of the Shadow Marches. How it got there, no one knows.\n\n**Hollow Structure**. Although it can operate without a crew, a warforged colossus is built to carry wizards, artificers, magewrights, and elite troops. For this reason, these constructs are largely hollow on the inside, with tunnels, ladders, storage areas, and observation decks.\n\nA colossus might be filled with monsters and secrets, in addition to the corpses of those who died inside it. In chapter 4, map 4.8 illustrates an inactive warforged colossus, and the text that accompanies it explains how the colossus might serve as an adventure location.",

        "Description": "Overlords\n-\n\nIn the first days of the world, the children of Khyber rose from the darkness to reign over Eberron. The greatest among them were the overlords, who held dominion over a world of fear, war, and death until the children of Eberron and Siberys rose up against them. Armies of dragons fought against the fiends of Khyber. And though the overlords couldn’t be destroyed, the couatl sacrificed their lives to build a prison of celestial light: a silver flame that bound the overlords in Khyber once more. These bonds have held for countless generations, but the overlords still yearn to break free and reclaim the world above.\n\nAs long as the overlords are bound by the Silver Flame, they can’t physically manifest in the world. But each overlord embodies a particular aspect of evil, which grows in strength as their servants — the fiends known as the Lords of Dust — scheme to unleash their ancient masters. The overlords gain strength when mortals embrace the dark paths laid down for them. And as they grow stronger, they gain more influence.\n\nSome thirty overlords are bound in Khyber. Two are described here: Rak Tulkhesh and Sul Khatesh, both of whom remain imprisoned and can’t take physical form. The stat blocks provided here reflect the powers they would wield if they were ever unleashed upon the world.\n\n**Immortal Nature**. An overlord doesn’t require air, food, drink or sleep. It also can’t die permanently. Upon its death, it reforms elsewhere in the multiverse and becomes active again at a time set by the DM.\n\nRak Tulkhesh\n-\n\nCalled the Rage of War, Rak Tulkhesh is the incarnation of impulses that drives many mortals to battle. Fear, greed, hatred — these are seeds that the Rage of War sows in the hopes of producing a bloody harvest.\n\nRak Tulkhesh typically takes the form of a vaguely draconic creature twisted by demonic rage. Covered in iron spikes protruding from his bleeding flesh, this overlord looms fifteen feet high at the shoulders, and his wings span over forty feet. While in combat, Rak Tulkhesh roars in rage as new weapons are spawned from his body, called forth by the Rage of War to slaughter all who dare stand before him.\n\n**Khyber Shards**. Rak Tulkhesh’s soul is divided among a group of Khyber shards spread through the underworld and is confined to those shards by the light of the Silver Flame. While shattered and bound, the Rage of War can’t bring his full power to bear on the world. But he can influence events in the vicinity of any of his shards, drawing power from acts of violence.\n\nThe Last War was a boon that allowed Rak Tulkhesh to darken the hearts of soldiers and civilians alike, whose actions then weakened the overlord’s bonds to give him even greater sway over the regions surrounding his shards. The violence seen in Thaliost and other occupied cities, the hatred against warforged and Cyran refugees, the calls for a return to war — all these things bear the mark of Rak Tulkhesh’s malign influence.\n\n**Minions of Rak Tulkhesh**. Any organization that fosters hatred unwittingly serves Rak Tulkhesh, and countless soldiers in the Five Nations are devoted to the Rage of War. Many of the Carrion Tribes of the Demon Wastes likewise serve Rak Tulkhesh and yearn to carry his bloody banner into the soft lands of the south. The minotaurs of Droaam revere Rak Tulkhesh as the Horned Prince. But the most powerful of the overlord’s follower’s is the rakshasa Mordakhesh the Shadowsword — Rak Tulkhesh’s exarch among the Lords of Dust, who commands a host of fiends exerting the overlord’s will across Khorvaire.",

A rakshasa named Mordakhesh rose up through the ranks to become one of the greatest commanders of his age, and a dragon-slaying specialist. For this, he earned the nickname Shadowsword, along with a legendary reputation for leaving death in his wake.\n\nMordakhesh serves as the prakhutu or “speaker” of his imprisoned master, Rak Tulkhesh, and he seeks to free his lord by bathing the world in blood. Like a spider with multiple webs, he has agents and pawns (which he calls his “claws”) established in armies across Khorvaire. The most significant of those is the barbarian horde he amasses in the Demon Wastes — warriors who threaten to sweep into Aundair on a tide of blood.\n\nMany of the horrors of the Last War were instigated — or at least encouraged — by Mordakhesh’s operatives, and his claws are known to have perpetrated some of the most brutal massacres of that conflict. No one knows how far the Shadowsword’s reach extends, or which commanders in the armies of Khorvaire serve him.",

The cruel and mighty Emperor Cul’sir of the giants laid a curse upon the druids and trapped them in the forms of animals. Just as the ancestors of the Valenar guide their warriors in battle, the spirits of these druids can awaken power in an animal to create a companion worthy of a champion.\n\nValenar animals are awakened to advanced intelligence and power by the touch of an ancestral spirit. Traditionally, Valenar animals choose Valenar elves as companions, reflecting a bond between the ancestors of elf and animal. To be chosen by a Valenar animal is a great honor, and any such elf is treated with respect and reverence.

        "Description": "Quori\n-\n\nDal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. Il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmares — the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The Inspired are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.\n\n**Hashalaq Quori**\n\nHashalaq quori are loremasters and judges, and are commonly known as dreamstealers. In their natural form, hashalaqs are composed of hundreds of translucent tendrils. They can compress and configure these tendrils to form a wide range of simple shapes. A point of blue light suspended within its tendrils serves as the hashalaq’s sensory organ, which can be moved around to suit the creature’s current shape.\n\n**The Power of Pleasure**. Hashalaq quori have studied their mortal prey for centuries. Inhabiting human bodies as Inspired has granted the hashalaq a deep understanding of the hedonistic urges of humanity. As a result, they have developed numerous ways to control humanoids through pleasure — even as they have developed a taste for such things themselves.\n\n**The Learned of Dal Quor**. Hashalaq quori are the loremasters of Dal Quor. Even those hashalaqs who don’t make use of Inspired vessels dedicate themselves to studying Eberron and the planes, and they are among the few quori castes whose members understand the ways of magic. In Dal Quor, the hashalaq quori are typically found as advisors to the kalaraq. They also serve as judges, policing the quori and ensuring that the rivalries of the tsucora never threaten the greater plans of the Dreaming Dark.",

        "Description": "Bone Knight\n-\n\nBone knights are the champions of the Order of the Emerald Claw. Clad in distinctive bonecraft armor — heavy armor adorned with the bones of fallen enemies — these fearsome warriors command squads of undead soldiers as they pursue the sinister goals of Lady Illmarrow.\n\n**Karrnathi Patriots**. Early in the Last War, Karrnath turned to the necromancers of the Blood of Vol to bolster the nation’s army with undead forces. The skeletons and zombies created by the necromancers were mindless creatures that required guidance. The first bone knights were appointed to provide this control.\n\nDevoted paladins of the Blood of Vol were fused into suits of bonecraft armor, whose magic focused their divine gifts, allowing them to command units of mindless undead. Bonecraft armor can’t be removed without killing the knight who wears it, and when donning it, each bone knight understood that their former life was over.\n\n**The Fall of the Emerald Claw**. During the Last War, many bone knights took service with the Order of the Emerald Claw, helping that name strike fear into the enemies of Karrnath. In the last decade, King Kaius III of Karrnath has done much to ensure a peaceful end to the Last War. Under the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, Kaius sealed most of Karrnath’s undead in deep vaults, and the Order of the Emerald Claw was disbanded. A few bone knights remained in service to the crown, but most were cast aside — still bound to their bonecraft armor and still convinced of Karrnathi supremacy. These bone knights felt that Kaius had betrayed both them and their nation, leading their once-proud order to find a new purpose in the service of Lady Illmarrow.",

Living spells most often manifest from evocation and conjuration spells. To make a living spell from a different spell, choose a damage-dealing evocation or conjuration spell from the wizard spell list of up to 5th level. Then consult the Living Spell Customization table to see which stat block to customize, based on the chosen spell’s level.\n\n***Living Spell Customization***\n\n\n\n**Spell Level**\n\n**Stat Block to Customize**\n\n\n\n\n***1–2***\n\n*Living burning hands*\n\n\n***3–4***\n\n*Living lightning bolt*\n\n\n***5***\n\n*Living cloudkill*\n\n\n\nNow make the following changes to that stat block:\n\n**Damage Immunity**. Replace the living spell’s damage immunity with immunity to the type (or types) of damage dealt by the chosen spell.\n\n**Magical Strike**. Replace the damage that Magical Strike deals with one type of damage dealt by the chosen spell.\n\n**Spell Mimicry**. Replace the effect of Spell Mimicry with the effect of the chosen spell. If that spell requires a saving throw, use spell save DC from the replaced spell, and if the spell involves an attack roll, use the attack bonus from the living spell’s Magical Strike.\n\nFor example, if you turn fireball (a 3rd-level spell) into a living spell, customize the living lightning bolt. The living fireball has immunity to fire damage, instead of lightning damage; deals fire damage with its Magical Strike; and replicates fireball with Spell Mimicry.",

        "Description": "Overlords\n-\n\nIn the first days of the world, the children of Khyber rose from the darkness to reign over Eberron. The greatest among them were the overlords, who held dominion over a world of fear, war, and death until the children of Eberron and Siberys rose up against them. Armies of dragons fought against the fiends of Khyber. And though the overlords couldn’t be destroyed, the couatl sacrificed their lives to build a prison of celestial light: a silver flame that bound the overlords in Khyber once more. These bonds have held for countless generations, but the overlords still yearn to break free and reclaim the world above.\n\nAs long as the overlords are bound by the Silver Flame, they can’t physically manifest in the world. But each overlord embodies a particular aspect of evil, which grows in strength as their servants — the fiends known as the Lords of Dust — scheme to unleash their ancient masters. The overlords gain strength when mortals embrace the dark paths laid down for them. And as they grow stronger, they gain more influence.\n\nSome thirty overlords are bound in Khyber. Two are described here: Rak Tulkhesh and Sul Khatesh, both of whom remain imprisoned and can’t take physical form. The stat blocks provided here reflect the powers they would wield if they were ever unleashed upon the world.\n\n**Immortal Nature**. An overlord doesn’t require air, food, drink or sleep. It also can’t die permanently. Upon its death, it reforms elsewhere in the multiverse and becomes active again at a time set by the DM.\n\nSul Khatesh\n-\n\nSul Khatesh is known as the Keeper of Secrets and the Queen of Shadows. She embodies the fears and superstitions surrounding magic, from malevolent warlocks to mad wizards, from deadly curses to magical power that draws those who wield it deeper into darkness.\n\nSul Khatesh is subtler than the Rage of War. She empowers warlocks and whispers secrets into the minds of wizards and artificers, helping them master spells and create relics they could never shape on their own. But few of those inspired by Sul Khatesh understand what forces they are dealing with, or recognize the danger inherent in her gifts.\n\n**The Queen of Shadows**. An entity of shadow, Sul Khatesh can assume any form. Her favored shape is a twelve-foot-tall humanoid figure draped in a flowing, hooded robe formed of swirling mist and clinging shadow.\n\n**Minions**. Most of Sul Khatesh’s followers are wizards and warlocks, and she is one of the primary patrons for warlocks in Khorvaire. Covens devoted to the Queen of Shadows use dark magic and fear to dominate whole communities, while isolated warlocks make pacts with Sul Khatesh to pursue power and revenge. By sharing her power in this way, the overlord perpetuates the image of the evil warlock, inciting fear that strengthens the Keeper of Secrets even more.\n\nSul Khatesh’s chief agent among the Lords of Dust is the rakshasa Hektula, who serves as the librarian in the demonic citadel of Ashtakala. Known as the First Scribe, Hektula presides over an immense trove of arcane knowledge and artifacts.",

        "Description": "Karrnathi Undead Soldier\n-\n\nUndead soldiers form the elite core of the army of Karrnath. Fearless and tireless, they are a terrifying sight on the battlefield. With the end of the Last War, most Karrnathi undead have been sealed in vaults below the city of Atur. However, the Karrnathi army keeps numerous undead in its service, while others have been commandeered by the malevolent Order of the Emerald Claw.\n\n**The Odakyr Rites**. The nation of Karrnath has a proud martial heritage, and its soldiers are unmatched in discipline. But in the early years of the Last War, Karrnath was crippled by famine and plague. In desperation, King Kaius I embraced the Blood of Vol, whose priests bolstered the armies of Karrnath with undead.\n\nInitially, those skeletons and zombies required constant control and served as cannon fodder. Over decades, a high priest named Malevanor worked with the necromancers of the Blood of Vol to develop the Odakyr Rites, which grant Karrnathi undead the ability to make tactical decisions and operate without direct guidance.\n\nThe Odakyr Rites work only when performed on the remains of a soldier slain in battle, and only in manifest zones tied to the plane of Mabar. The most significant such zones in Karrnath exist in the cities of Atur and Odakyr (now called Fort Bones). The number of Karrnathi undead soldiers steadily increased over the course of the war, with the losses of Karrnath’s living troops offset by the recovery and raising of their remains.\n\nMalevanor claimed that Karrnathi undead are animated and granted intelligence by the patriotic spirit of Karrnath. However, many Karrns fear that the undead are vessels for a darker power — and that Lady Illmarrow or someone else will turn the undead against the living.\n\n**Intelligent and Inhuman**. Karrnathi undead bear little resemblance to the people they were in life. These undead are content to stand motionless and silent for days. They show no emotion, and certainly no mercy or compassion. Undead soldiers kill any opposing forces — including civilians among those forces — unless given explicit instructions to the contrary.\n\nA few exceptional Karrnathi undead retain their individuality and the memories of their former lives. Such undead are often found as champions of the Blood of Vol or agents of the Order of the Emerald Claw.\n\n**Undead Nature**. A Karrnathi undead soldier doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

        "Description": "Belashyrra\n-\n\nBelashyrra makes its lair in the Citadel of Lidless Eyes deep in Khyber, a site that appears to have been molded from molten stone, chitin, and flesh. Across its warped and liquid expanses, thousands of eyes of every size and shape peer into the endless darkness. Beholders, dolgrims, and stranger aberrations dwell within the halls of the citadel, which is one of the few places where such creatures are willing to live side by side.\nSome beholderkin serve Belashyrra as guards and agents, while others spend their lives in deep meditation, pursuing inner visions known only to the Lord of Eyes. It’s rumored that anyone who sits on the citadel’s throne can see through the eyes of any sentient creature on Eberron or in Khyber. If encountered in its lair, Belashyrra has a challenge rating of 23 (50,000 XP).\n\nLair Actions.\n-\n\nWhile within the Citadel of Lidless Eyes, Belashyrra can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Belashyrra can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n•An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of Belashyrra. One random eye ray of Belashyrra’s shoots from that eye at a target of Belashyrra’s choice that it can see. The eye then closes and disappears.\n\n•Belashyrra creates a wave of madness. Each creature it can see within its lair must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, a creature must use its action at the start of its turn before moving to make a melee attack against another creature of Belashyrra’s choice within reach. If there are no creatures within reach, the charmed creature can act normally for that turn. A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n•Belashyrra taps into the eyesight of creatures in its lair and alters their perception. Each creature of Belashyrra’s choice in the lair must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the affected creature perceives objects and creatures a short distance from their actual locations, imposing disadvantage on the creature’s attack rolls against those targets. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this lair action for the next 24 hours.\n\nRegional Effects.\n-\n\nBelashyrra’s lair is known to touch remote areas of the Shadow Marches and caverns below Xen’drik. A region containing a passage to Belashyrra’s lair is warped by its magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n•Creatures within 1 mile of the passage sometimes feel as if they’re being watched.\n\n•Beasts that live within 5 miles of the passage undergo magical transmutation, growing eyes or eyestalks that Belashyrra can see through.\n\n•A humanoid who spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the passage must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a type of madness (see “Madness of Belashyrra” below). A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can’t be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.\n\nIf Belashyrra dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.\n\nMadness of Belashyrra\n-\n\nIf a creature goes mad in Belashyrra’s lair or while it can see the daelkyr, it gains a form of indefinite madness. Roll on the Madness of Belashyrra table to determine the nature of this madness, which takes the form of a character flaw that lasts until cured. Chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide has more information on madness.\n\n**Madness of Belashyrra**\nd6\nFlaw (lasts until cured)\n\n***1***\n“I constantly see shapes moving in the shadows.”\n\n\n***2***\n“I perceive certain types of people — vocations or entire societies — as hideous monsters.”\n\n\n***3***\n“Someone is watching everything I do.”\n\n\n***4***\n“When I close my eyes, I see my past misdeeds.”\n\n\n***5***\n“I don’t trust my sight. I have no idea what’s real and what’s a hallucination.”\n\n\n***6***\n“Something watches the world through my eyes. To thwart them, I keep my eyes closed or covered.”",

Replace the damage that Magical Strike deals with one type of damage dealt by the chosen spell.\n\n**Spell Mimicry**. Replace the effect of Spell Mimicry with the effect of the chosen spell. If that spell requires a saving throw, use spell save DC from the replaced spell, and if the spell involves an attack roll, use the attack bonus from the living spell’s Magical Strike.\n\nFor example, if you turn fireball (a 3rd-level spell) into a living spell, customize the living lightning bolt.

He has established a nation for his people deep in the Mournland, centered in a great fortress where warforged from all over Khorvaire can come and feel a sense of belonging. No one knows what the Lord of Blades plans for his followers, but many fear that he intends to build a legion of warforged zealots, primed to march from the Mournland to unleash destruction on their former masters.\n\nSome tales assert that the Lord of Blades led the warforged armies of Cyre in the Last War. Others cast him as a newer warforged, perhaps the last to come out of the Cannith creation forges before the Thronehold Accords led to their dismantling. One story claims the Lord of Blades caused the destruction of Cyre and warns that he plans to repeat the Day of Mourning in each of the remaining Five Nations. Whatever the truth, he has become a beacon for warforged everywhere.\n\n**Warforged Nature**. The Lord of Blades doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

The warforged were created to fight in the Last War, and in the aftermath of that conflict, they struggle to understand their place in the world.\n\nMost warforged soldiers still serve their former masters, often guarding dragonmarked houses or merchant caravans. Many warforged find it difficult to separate themselves from the soldiers they were made to be, seeking work as bouncers, bailiffs, and bodyguards. Others put their tireless strength to work as laborers, committed to the reconstruction of the towns and cities they defended or destroyed in the war.",

A chef might use prestidigitation to heat and season food, while a blacksmith uses mending to perform minor repairs and guidance to help inspire their work. Those who work minor magic into their labors are called magewrights.\n\nFar more limited in magical power than a typical spellcaster, a magewright is dedicated to learning a handful of spells, and magewrights cast their non-cantrip spells as rituals — even spells that can’t normally be cast in this way. Most magewright rituals take 10 minutes to perform, but certain complex rituals can take up to 1 hour. However long the ritual takes, it requires extra material components, usually in the form of dragonshards.\n\n**Creating a Magewright**\n\nThe magewright stat block provides the baseline statistics for a magewright. You then add to that baseline by choosing a specialty from the Magewright Specialties table, or roll for one. The specialty determines additional spells the magewright knows, including ones that can be cast only as rituals. The specialty also gives the magewright more proficiencies.\n\n***Magewright Specialties***\n\n\n\n\n**d\u00008**\n\n**Specialty**\n\n**Spells**\n\n**Proficiencies**\n\n\n\n\n***1***\n\n*Artisan*\n\n*Guidance, mending*\n\n*One type of artisan's tools*\n\n\n***2***\n\n*Entertainer*\n\n*Minor illusion, thaumaturgy.

            "Description": "Bone Knight\n-\n\nBone knights are the champions of the Order of the Emerald Claw. Clad in distinctive bonecraft armor — heavy armor adorned with the bones of fallen enemies — these fearsome warriors command squads of undead soldiers as they pursue the sinister goals of Lady Illmarrow.\n\n**Karrnathi Patriots**. Early in the Last War, Karrnath turned to the necromancers of the Blood of Vol to bolster the nation’s army with undead forces. The skeletons and zombies created by the necromancers were mindless creatures that required guidance. The first bone knights were appointed to provide this control.\n\nDevoted paladins of the Blood of Vol were fused into suits of bonecraft armor, whose magic focused their divine gifts, allowing them to command units of mindless undead. Bonecraft armor can’t be removed without killing the knight who wears it, and when donning it, each bone knight understood that their former life was over.\n\n**The Fall of the Emerald Claw**. During the Last War, many bone knights took service with the Order of the Emerald Claw, helping that name strike fear into the enemies of Karrnath. In the last decade, King Kaius III of Karrnath has done much to ensure a peaceful end to the Last War. Under the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, Kaius sealed most of Karrnath’s undead in deep vaults, and the Order of the Emerald Claw was disbanded. A few bone knights remained in service to the crown, but most were cast aside — still bound to their bonecraft armor and still convinced of Karrnathi supremacy. These bone knights felt that Kaius had betrayed both them and their nation, leading their once-proud order to find a new purpose in the service of Lady Illmarrow.",
