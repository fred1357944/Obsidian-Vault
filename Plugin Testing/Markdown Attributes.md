[Both internal and external links can by styled.](https://www.wikipedia.com) {.internal-link}

`inline code and code blocks can be styled too!` {.center}

The plugin supports all HTML attributes. For example, you could give a line a tooltip like this. {aria-label="tooltip" style="width: max-content;"}

Inline markdown elements can also be styled. For example, ==I want to be red! {.red}==.
A full paragraph can also be styled.
Even a block with multiple newlines.
Like this!
{.smallcaps}
