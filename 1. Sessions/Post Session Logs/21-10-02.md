The group started the session divided. Bob had started working his way up to the canopy of the clantree to get a better view of the Volcano, but soon realized he was being followed. Mim and Merigold went to bed, and Josiah was speaking to Drox and attuning to his new greatsword.

Bob was attacked by the lizardfolk following when he started to head towards a blood fued being settled, while simultaneously the clan witch of the Cold Sun entered the greathouse with her huge muscled bodyguard who was wearing an incredible shimmering rainbow cloak. She displayed the coin of dust that Bob had been carried and ominously asked where the carrier of the coin was, because everyone was in grave danger. Mim and Merigold entered the room, and Mim asked what was going on. She tried to call Bob on her cellstone but he ignored the call, making her mad - so she threw a plant at the coin and left the room. Merigold tried to stop her but was too slow, and when the plant struck the coin it exploded into dust. Bob and the lizardfolk continued flailing at each other.

When the dust settled from the coin, a huge humanoid tiger was standing in the room. Jeremiah recognized it as the same race of tiger creatures he was fighting in his vision. The great witch, Agathax, had been thrown outside by the force of the magical blast and was unconscious. Mim saw her bodyguard lift her up and run towards the middle of the tree.

The tiger creature said something in a deep guttural language that none of you understood, then attacked Drox. It killed Drox, then before you could kill it, it plane shifted away.

Merigold and Jeremiah went to find Bob, while Mim went to a bar. She eventually decided to try to find the great witch to get some answers. Merigold and Jeremiah found Bob and saved him, but Jeremiah executed the lizardfolk. His shield began to burn his arm and he had to throw it off, then he went unconscious and fell to the ground.
