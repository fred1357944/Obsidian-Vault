## Strong Start

```ad-recite
title:

The four of you stand in front of your boat, which has been pulled up on the bank slightly in a small inlet off the river. Pust has just vanished into the forest, leaving you alone. The mid-afternoon sky is filled with smoke and ash from the clan tree, but your immediate surroundings are eerily silent, broken only by the sound of the river rushing past and the occasional dragon roar that echo throughout the jungle.

```

## Scenes

### ENTER NEWTHRONE
[[Newthrone]]

```ad-map
collapse: closed
![[Newthrone#Map]]
```

####

```ad-recite


The river curves gently to the south, then suddenly the trees open up and finally, Newthrone lies ahead of you. Large marble-white walls encircle the city, extending off of the river on both sides. Airships swarm in the skies above the city, a chaotic stream of ships landing and taking off from the flying docks. One airship in particular stands out - it is listing to one side at its dock, and is significantly fire damaged. 

Mim, from your travels here before, you remember that the only harbor for the city is just past the Bleakbridge, nearer to the sea. You also remember that the harbor tends to be just as chaotic as the skies, with ships of all sizes constantly moving a round the river.
