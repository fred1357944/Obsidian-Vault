### Bob Meets the Shamans
- "This coin... it has left a filth on you"
- The three ancient lizard women sit in a circle facing the middle of the hut, and [[Chiax]] gestures for you to sit in the middle of them.
- All three begin chanting in unison, and dozens of candles flare to life around the edge of the hut with a bright green flame that casts flickering shadows as a wind begins to blow.
- She shudders, then draws a deep, ragged breath and looks up with empty eyes that slowly turn black. She stares through you, unseeing, then throws her head back:
	
	> _THE LADY OF DEATH, BLIND TO HER SHROUD OF DUST
	> WORKS TO UNDO HER TERRIBLE CURSE
	> BUT IN DOING SO, SHE WILL
	> THE WORLD WILL MOURN
