## Characters

list from #pc/alive 
```

## Strong Start

> Bob and Merigold, you are standing above Jeremiah's unconscious form. Lizardfolk are starting to trickle back onto the platform, and you hear a commotion from across a bridge, where several grey-scaled lizardfolk are pointing at you and gesturing wildy. What are you doing?

> Mim, you start moving towards the middle of the Clan Tree in search of Agathax the witch. As you head out, you hear someone rushing up towards you and see Yoss, Drox's servant, rushing up to you. He reaches you and catches his breath, then says, "Mistress Mim, please, we have to do something. Please, I do not know what to do."
>
> "The clan witch? Agathax was hurt? Her warden must have taken her to the witchhouse, in the center of the clan tree."

## Scenes

### Vision of the Flame

````ad-flame

Jeremiah, you open your eyes to see that you're laying on top of a stepped pyramid overlooking a sprawling city. [[Tira Moran|Someone]] in bright, shining, silver full plate armor is crouched down staring at you through a visor. Behind them you can see a large roaring bonfire in front of an ornate citadel. When they notice you're awake, they stand up and walk to the edge of the platform, and the bonfire's flames reflecting off their plate make them glow with a soft silver light. Over her shoulder, she calls:

The flame does not take the slaughtering of the defenseless lightly, mortal.

```

What are you doing, Jeremiah?

````ad-flame

She turns to regard you, the flames reflection dancing in her gleaming armor.

```ad-quote

The dust lord [[Durastoran the Wyrmbreaker]] has set his plans in motion. The lady of death is the key.
