## Strong Start
- mim is with agathax + yoss (unconscious) + bodyguard
- bob, merigold and jeremiah are long resting in their guest room

> Bob, Merigold, Jeremiah, the three of you are getting ready to rest in your guesthouse. The volcano is causing the eastern horizon to glow a dull orange, even through the storm that is raging outside. 
>
> Mim, you are alone in Agathax's witch hut, with Agathax and Yoss's unconcious forms floating in the middle of the hut, wrapped in a soft purple light. You can just barely catch glimpses of the shimmering rainbow cloak of Agathax's bodyguard as he moves through the storm. 
> 
> The four of you are long resting?

## Scenes
### Attack on Agathax
````ad-dnd
title:
Mim, throughout the night, you are woken several times by the sound of quick battles, and the screams of dying lizardfolk as they are cut down by Agathax's bodyguard, but otherwise sleep soundly through the night. As you begin to wake, you see that Agathax's body is no longer floating in the hut - she is now sitting upright in her chair, watching you with intent. The bodyguard is slumped against a wall, eyes closed - he is covered in blood and crisscrossed with shallow cuts. He has his hand against his right abdomen, and you see a dark red bloodstain on his shirt around his hand. His shimmering cloak is thrown on the floor next to him.

Agathax smiles at you, and says:

````

> Good morning, child. I fear we do not have much time. [[Rhashaak]], the Wyrm of Fire, the Eternal One, Bringer of Death, has emerged from [[Haka'Torvhak]].  We must be quick. [[Arawai]] knows what has called him forth.


```ad-quote
title: Agathax
"The coin holder...he has been tainted. Listen to me, child. He must be cleansed! Get to Newthrone, and seek the [[Sovereign Host]]."
```
