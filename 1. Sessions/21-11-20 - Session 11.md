## Characters

list from #pc/alive 
```

## Strong Start
- mim is with agathax + yoss (unconscious) + bodyguard
- bob, merigold and jeremiah are long resting in their guest room

> Bob, Merigold, Jeremiah, the three of you are getting ready to rest in your guesthouse. The volcano is causing the eastern horizon to glow a dull orange, even through the storm that is raging outside. 
>
> Mim, you are alone in Agathax's witch hut, with Agathax and Yoss's unconcious forms floating in the middle of the hut, wrapped in a soft purple light. You can just barely catch glimpses of the shimmering rainbow cloak of Agathax's bodyguard as he moves through the storm. 
> 
> The four of you are long resting?

Mim: 
````ad-dnd
title:
Mim, throughout the night, you are woken several times by the sound of battle, and the screams of dying lizardfolk as they are cut down by Agathax's bodyguard, but otherwise sleep soundly through the night. As you begin to wake, you see that Agathax's body is no longer floating in the hut - she is now sitting upright in her chair, watching you with intent. The bodyguard is slumped against a wall, eyes closed - he is covered in blood and crisscrossed with shallow cuts. He has his hand against his right abdomen, and you see a dark red bloodstain on his shirt around his hand. His shimmering cloak is piled on the floor next to him.

Agathax smiles sadly at you, and says:
```ad-quote
title: Agathax

Good morning, child. That was...quite the night, wouldn't you agree?

I fear we do not have much time. It seems [[Rhashaak]], the Wyrm of Fire, the Eternal One, Bringer of Death, has emerged from [[Haka'Torvhak]]. We must convince the tribes to flee.

Let us return to your group, yes, and speak with Drox?
 
```
**CUT TO GROUP**

````

Group:
````ad-dnd
title:
The rest of you sleep through the night without incident. The balcony, though open to the storm, was able to buffet the winds and rain enough to keep the interior calm. You wake to the sun just cresting the horizon to the east. The volcano has stopped erupting, but the jungle around its base is burning, and ash began falling on the clan tree at some point during the night, coating the balcony.

## Scenes
### Attack on [[Agathax]]

```ad-dnd
title:

The bodyguard stands with a grunt of pain, collects his cloak, and limps towards the door, following Agathax. The platform outside the door is coated in a fine layer of ash, making it slippery and difficult to walk.

```


#### If They lie to Agathax
**Deception Check** (Agathax +4 Perception)

#### If Agathax Dies:
```ad-quote
title: Agathax
The coin holder...he has been marked. He must be cleansed! Get to Newthrone, and seek the [[Sovereign Host]]."
```
