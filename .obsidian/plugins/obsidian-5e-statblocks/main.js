Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect.

Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording.

/**
 * Base class to create strongly typed Svelte components.
 * This only exists for typing purposes and should be used in `.d.ts` files.
 *
 * ### Example:
 *
 * You have component library on npm called `component-library`, from which
 * you export a component called `MyComponent`. For Svelte+TypeScript users,
 * you want to provide typings. Therefore you create a `index.d.ts`:
 * ```ts
 * import { SvelteComponentTyped } from "svelte";
 * export class MyComponent extends SvelteComponentTyped<{foo: string}> {}
 * ```
 * Typing this makes it possible for IDEs like VS Code with the Svelte extension
 * to provide intellisense and to use the component like this in a Svelte file
 * with TypeScript:
 * ```svelte
 * <script lang="ts">
 * 	import { MyComponent } from "component-library";
 * </script>
 * <MyComponent foo={'bar'} />
 * ```
 *
 * #### Why not make this part of `SvelteComponent(Dev)`?
 * Because
 * ```ts
 * class ASubclassOfSvelteComponent extends SvelteComponent<{foo: string}> {}
 * const component: typeof SvelteComponent = ASubclassOfSvelteComponent;
 * ```
 * will throw a type error, so we need to separate the more strictly typed class.
