### Things to Remember
- MY VALUE
- robot was 1/3rd the cost, twice as efficient and twice as accurate
- legacy web app is entirely front end based, my redesign moves all of the processing serverside and isolates expensive operations into their own thread
- masking controller allowed associates to mask parts with much greater precision that legacy system (under 0.005")


### My projects
- masking applicator
	- my first big software development project
	- took the initiative to design and create a new masking application
	- allows associates to mask to a *much* higher accuracy than previous which allowed new business 
	- nodejs app running in electron with a vuejs front end
- robot project
	- 1/3 the cost, twice as fast, twice as efficient
	- programmed the robot completely, programmed the feeder logic controller and an HMI
	- HMI (nodejs + vuejs frontend) allows leadership and associates to see metrics on how parts are performing
- current timer web app
	- nodejs express app with a vuejs frontend
	- redesign from scratch of old legacy system
	- legacy app was entirely front end, so I moved all processing server side to allow for persistence
	- I also multithreaded the app to move expensive database and io operations to prevent performance issues on the server
	- worked closely with associates to understand their pain points and what new features they need

### Questions
![[Questions]]


### Prep

#### Tell me about yourself

- degreed mechanical engineer, graduated from ohio state in 2013
- spent several years as a product engineer, both in the medical field and the automotive field, where i managed the life cycle of products from start to finish to meet customer design requirements and quality standards were met
- became an r&d engineer at abrasive where I carved out a software engineering role for myself, taking ownership over designing and redesigning web apps used internally and handling the programming of robots for our automated work cells
- which made me realize i wanted to do software engineering full time

pluralsight + linkedin learning - 8 hrs of CE required per year
#### Why do you want to work for this company?

- from conversations with misty Kuamoo and derya, nationwide seems to be the kind of place that fosters the kind of continuous growth and learning that I thrive in
- the team seems to be innovative and I love that I'll get to work with external partners, something I loved as part of my product engineering experience
- I've noticed that several people I've met with have been with the company over ten years, so obviously they're doing something right!

#### Five years / goal
- tech lead or technical expert
- in a place where i can mentor junior devs

#### Strengths / Weaknesses
##### Strengths
- ability and desire to learn
- when I started lathe controller I did a deep dive into JavaScript, learned electron, learned vuejs and some front end concepts
- took ownership of the software development role
- took ownership of programming our robots and learned the programming language

##### Weakness
- self confidence
- whether that's imposter syndrome or just feeling out of my depth
- try to step back and collect myself, remind myself of my qualifications, where I've come from, the project goals and scope
- if still not feeling confident I'll reach out to team members, do some research on best practices, and refocus

#### What are you looking for in this job?

I am looking for a job where I can continue to grow and learn as a software engineer. I feel like at my current position I have reached the limit of my potential as a software engineer because I am working as a solo developer, where I I feel like this environment and this team is a place that fosters that kind of growth that kind of learning, innovation, newest perspectives. I also loved working with  external partners to understand their design needs and requirements and develop a product with them in my previous position and am excited to be able to do that again

#### Why should we hire you

You should hire me because I am an incredibly passionate software engineer that loves to continuously learn and grow, while simultaneously having a unique perspective thanks to my mechanical engineering and product engineering background, where I have experience working with external partners to understand and meet their design requirements and needs. This combination, with my software development skills, would be a asset to the team.
