### Prep

#### Why do you want to work for this company?
Derya mentioned how well Nationwide supports personal and professional growth, which is important to me - I always want to be learning.

Nationwide appears to have an incredible company culture - especially considering I've seen several people have worked for Nationwide for over a decade!

#### Five years / goal
- tech lead? technical expert
- in a place where i can mentor junior devs

#### Strengths / Weaknesses
- attention to detail

- self confidence?
> I always say that I have struggled with self-confidence in the past and can sometimes second guess myself, and that this is something I have improved on greatly and I take a few seconds to calm down and focus and then come back to the task feeling better.
