This letter is to inform you of my intention to resign from my position as an engineer with Abrasive Technology, effective April 8th, 2022. 

I appreciate the time I spent here as a Research and Development Engineer, where I was able to foster my passion for learning and grow into a software engineer. The skills I have gained from Abrasive Technology will carry me throughout the rest of my career, and I am thankful for the opportunity.

Brandon, in the short time I've worked with you here, I can already see the impact that you will have on the team moving forward. Please let me know if there is anything that I can do in the next two weeks to help aid during the transition.

I wish you, the RD&E team, and the company continued success.

Thank you,
Jeremy Valentine
