 *
 * Here is an example source map, taken from the source map spec[0]:

/**
 * An IndexedSourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which

 * that it takes "indexed" source maps (i.e. ones with a "sections" field) as
 * input.
 *
 * The first parameter is a raw source map (either as a JSON string, or already
 * parsed to an object). According to the spec for indexed source maps, they
 * have the following attributes:
 *
 *   - version: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.
 *   - file: Optional. The generated file this source map is associated with.
 *   - sections: A list of section definitions.
 *
 * Each value under the "sections" field has two fields:
 *   - offset: The offset into the original specified at which this section
 *       begins to apply, defined as an object with a "line" and "column"
 *       field.
 *   - map: A source map definition. This source map could also be indexed,
 *       but doesn't have to be.
 *
 * Instead of the "map" field, it's also possible to have a "url" field
 * specifying a URL to retrieve a source map from, but that's currently
 * unsupported.
 *
 * Here's an example source map, taken from the source map spec[0], but
 * modified to omit a section which uses the "url" field.
 *
 *  {
 *    version : 3,
 *    file: "app.js",
 *    sections: [{
 *      offset: {line:100, column:10},
 *      map: {
 *        version : 3,
 *        file: "section.js",
 *        sources: ["foo.js", "bar.js"],
 *        names: ["src", "maps", "are", "fun"],
 *        mappings: "AAAA,E;;ABCDE;"
 *      }
 *    }],
 *  }
 *
 * The second parameter, if given, is a string whose value is the URL
 * at which the source map was found.  This URL is used to compute the
 * sources array.

On a failure, a target takes 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.\nIf the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone.",

Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording.

Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\nWishes.\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.",

The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies.
