## Boneyard
*Ancient, unexplained burial site of dragons*

The Boneyard is a valley in the Talenta Plains filled with many skeletons of dragons. The valley lies at the juncture of the Endworld and Ironroot Mountains and the Blade Desert. The halfling clans (including the [[Yirr Tribe]] & [[Merigold]]) of the Plains consider the place to be cursed and will not willingly enter it. It is extremely ancient and its origin is unknown.

In recent years dragonborn from Q'barra have begun making pilgrimages to the site.
