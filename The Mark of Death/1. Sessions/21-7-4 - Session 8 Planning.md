# Session 8
### Adventure seed
[[3 - Travel to Newthrone]] ^b8e498

## Characters

```dataview
list from #pc/alive 
```

## Strong Start
> The servant opens the door to the guesthouse, and you step into a utilitarian common room. A wooden table large enough to sit eight people sits to your left, along with a small pantry, and on the right are several sitting chairs arrayed around an unlit stone fireplace. Three doors in the back are open and through each you see a simple bed against the wall. The servant enters behind you, still limping and with a pained look on his face, and then stands to one side. He says:

I have been instructed by my master to see to your needs. The full clanhold is at your disposal, but I must warn you - the other clans have begun arriving, and blood fueds will be settled this night. Please let me know if you require anything.

**SWITCH TO BOB**

````ad-info
While the three of you take in the house, Bob, where would you like to go?
````

````ad-info

Bob, as you move through the village, Lizardfolk are swinging through the trees all around you. Most of the platforms you can see around you are teeming with groups of them going about their day, and you begin to see signs of the different clans - you see a group all wearing bright golden feathers, another who have all painted their faces red.

Bob, give me a perception check.

```ad-success
collapse: closed
As tyou move through the crowds, you catch a glimpse of a lizardfolk with ashy-grey skin clawhook his way into the treetop above you, but you don't see him afterwards. You suddenly realize that he's been following you for, as you have caught glimpses of him a few times.
```

```ad-fail
collapse: closed
You can't see anything in the mass of lizardfolk on the platform.

## Scenes

### Delivery of the Chest

```ad-treasure
The chest is rather large but plainly designed, made out of a dark grey wood that you, Mim, recognize as Xen'Drik'n floatwood used by some Lhazaar pirates for shipbuilding. Two leather latches secure it. The chest looks brand new, despite its apparent age, and the lid is feather light even though it looks sturdidly built.

The chest is full of old, old Galifar gold coins, still depicting the first king of Khorvaire. Resting on top of the coins is a longsword made out of the same floatwood as the chest, lacquered and polished until its surface shines. Half buried underneath the gold is a pair of silver-armored leather gauntlets, palms glowing with a soft blue sigil.

### Assault on Bob / Bob Meets the Shamans

- "This coin... it has left a filth on you"
- The three ancient lizard women sit in a circle facing the middle of the hut, and [[Chiax]] gestures for you to sit in the middle of them.
- All three begin chanting in unison, and dozens of candles flare to life around the edge of the hut with a bright green flame that casts flickering shadows as a wind begins to blow.
- She shudders, then draws a deep, ragged breath and looks up with empty eyes that slowly turn black. She stares through you, unseeing, then throws her head back:
	
	> _THE LADY OF DEATH, BLIND TO HER SHROUD OF DUST
	> WORKS TO UNDO HER TERRIBLE CURSE
	> BUT IN DOING SO, SHE WILL
	> REPEAT YOUR FATHER'S GRAVE MISTAKE_
