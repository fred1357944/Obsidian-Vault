## Strong Start
> The servant opens the door to the guesthouse, and you step into a utilitarian common room. A wooden table large enough to sit eight people sits to your left, along with a small pantry, and on the right are several sitting chairs arrayed around an unlit stone fireplace. In the middle of the room is a large chest made out of a gray wood. Three doors in the back are open and through each you see a simple bed against the wall. The servant enters the room, still limping slightly, and then stands to one side. He says: 

```ad-quote
title: Yoss
I have been instructed by my master to see to your needs. The full clanhold is at your disposal.

The chest is yours, templar. We have held it for hundreds of years, awaiting the return of the Flame to reclaim it.
```

```ad-treasure
collapse: true
The chest is rather large but plainly designed, made out of a dark grey wood that you, Mim, recognize as Xen'Drik'n floatwood used by some Lhazaar pirates for shipbuilding. Two leather latches secure it. The chest looks brand new, despite its apparent age, and the lid is feather light even though it looks sturdidly built.

The chest is full of old, old Galifar gold coins, still depicting the first king of Khorvaire. Resting on top of the coins is a longsword made out of the same floatwood as the chest, lacquered and polished until its surface shines. Half buried underneath the gold is a pair of silver-armored leather gauntlets, palms glowing with a soft blue sigil.
