#### Notes

#### Conflict - The Blackscales Attack

[REFERENCE THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/6acd7t/guide_to_the_jungle/)

> The lizardman chieftain, [[Drox]], leads you east away from the riverbank and through the thick undergrowth. As you move away from the river the undergrowth begins grows sparse, and very little light reaches down to the jungle floor here.

```ad-quote
The clanhold lies about half a day east. Please, before we begin, have some refreshment. 
```

> He holds out a waterskin and pulls out a large golden fruit that you've never seen before and offers it, saying:

```ad-quote
A single bite of the [[Sun Cedar Fruit|fruit of the Sun Cedar]] will heal your wounds. It is not often we offer this to outsiders.  
```

> The fruit is slightly sweet and juicy, and as you eat it you feel your body healing itself. After just a few moments, you also feel completely refreshed -- as if you've just had a peaceful long rest.
>
> He continues to lead you deeper into the forest. It's hard to see much around you between the gloom and the dense trees, but [[Drox]] seems to be able to see a winding trail in the leaves on the ground. You hear animals moving about in the trees above you, but can't see anything but the distant canopy when you look.

> After another mile or so, [[Drox]] calls for a halt in a small clearing defined by several fallen trees. He gestures at you, Jeremiah, and says:

```ad-quote
The Crazy Fist are truly honored to have an esteemed Templar in our midst. We would have you speak at the Council, so that we may learn of the Flame's intentions.
```

> As the two of you are speaking, suddenly from the jungle you hear a _TWANG_ and a bright green arrow buries itself into the tree next to Drox. Drox swears, then hurriedly jumps behind one of the fallen trees and calls for you to hide. **ROLL INITIATIVE**

```ad-battle
- 1 Lizardfolk Render (blackscale) [[Kaz]], 
- 2 Lizardfolk Scaleshield (blackscale), 
- 2 Yuan-ti Pureblood (poisondusk)
```
