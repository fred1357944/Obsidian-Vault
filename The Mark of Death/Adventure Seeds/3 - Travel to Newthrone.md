#### Notes

#### Entrance

![boat](https://boatingforbeginners.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/directions-on-a-boat-1.jpg)

> The current quickly pulls the ship away from town. Eventually, the river curves around to the east, heading deeper into the jungle - all you can see of the town is the orange of the burning airship glowing in the night sky.
>
> An everbright lantern on the mast illuminates the deck and allows you to take stock of the boat.  A platform at the stern has the ship's wheel rising out of it, and stairs lead under the platform to a small sleeping area. Two oars are lying on the deck against the side of the boat, and a bench sits at the bow with two oar holes, close enough that one person could row. On the mast, a sail is furled, and a small crows nest sits on top.

- **What are you doing on the ship?**
- **Mim, you have the Newthrone Gazette**

##### Assassin Vines

> As the dawn rises, the river begins to widen and the current slows the boat to a crawl. The jungle is thick and impenetrable on both banks of the river. It is extremely humid on the river, and the sun is hot. Some of the trees have grown far out over the river, and long vines hang down from them, trailing in the water. You begin to hear the sounds of jungle life - the calls of hundreds of birds, the buzzing of insects flying around you, even something _very_ large moving through the growth on the bank. As you continue down the river, you see a herd of clawfoot raptors drinking, but the boat disturbs them and they dash off into the jungle.

**Perception Check** DC 15 to notice some vines ahead are moving the wrong way - 2 Assassin vines **(HP: 50)**

#### Parley - Meeting the Lizardfolk

> The river slows further, and seems to barely even be moving in this part of the jungle. A group of apes peers down at the boat from up in the trees, and follow along with you for a couple hours, but they eventually drop down into the underbrush and you lose sight of them. Eventually, night falls over the jungle. You can barely see anything past the light of the lantern. The animal calls sound eerie in the darkness, and they sound much closer than they did during the day. **What are you doing during nightfall?**

##### Cold Sun

> ![Cold Sun Lizardfolk|200](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/eberron/images/3/31/MM35_PG169.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20120116182459)
> The next morning is uneventful, but in the early afternoon you see a large pile of debris caught on something spanning the entire river. Several lizardfolk moving about on the debris, but they seem to be clearing it out. One of them raises a large spear and calls out, "Passage is blocked! Stop your boat!"

- The blockage is debris piling up on a group of dead brontosauruses
- The brontosauruses has a huge chunk ripped out of its throat, and is peppered with green-shafted arrows with black fletching
- The lizardfolk hold Templars of the Silver Flame in high esteem - **all will bow to Jeremiah when he meets them**

```ad-quote
Greetings, travelers. I am the one known as Drox, chieftan of the Crazy Fist Cold Sun. 
```

#### Setback - Drums in the Jungle

[[Generators/Names/Lizardfolk Names]]

> The lizardmen stand suddenly, and they all look off to the east -- eventually, the sound of a steady drumbeat rises from deep into the jungle, and they start looking at each other, concern on their faces. The chieftain walks to your side and says:
 ```ad-quote
 Hmm. The blackscales. They again attempt to summon one of the ancient demon lords.
 ```

> Then a rhythmic chanting rises above the drums, getting louder and louder and louder and louder and louder until its the only thing you can hear, becoming unbearable but it just doesn't stop and it just keeps getting louder, drowning out all other sounds until you can't concentrate on anything but the chanting, and then suddenly it cuts off. The jungle is dead silent for a few seconds until a monstrous roar sounds out from the same direction. The lizardfolk look at each other, distressed, then to their chieftain, who addresses them :

```ad-quote
They are getting closer. We must prevent this. A tribal council must be called. 

***He points to the Lizardfolk that warned you of the blockage, earlier.***

Jix, get word to the other clans. Move quickly. Away!

***The lizardfolk, Jix, unfurls a clawhook tied to his belt and swings it at the trees on the bank; it wraps around the branches, then Jix releases a switch on a handle and he swings off into the jungle.***
```

# Complete
## Session Start

- Bob: Why is Mim the way she is?

> The three of you are standing at the entrance to the ancient Dhakaani temple. Quinn's dead body lies on the ground, but as you watch it, it seems to melt away, leaving nothing but his bones on the ground, which quickly turn to ash.
>
> Are you long resting here?
> Jeremiah, how do you feel about your vision? Do you tell Mim and Bob about it?

> Backtracking through the mine doesn't take much effort. The miners that you rescued at the entrance are peering outside of it, looking around. When they see the group, they tell you that the bodies of the gang members you killed melted away into nothing, just like you saw Quinn's do. The camp on top is completely deserted by now, but the bulette you released caused significant damage.
>
> **Do you do anything on the journey back to town?**

#### Notes

- House Tharashk has come to investigate reports of the death of Ven Leser
- Jim currently has owns the only docked boat

#### Entrance

> As you approach the town, you see a large airship hovering in the sky just outside it, emblazoned with the symbol of House Tharashk and the name _Hunter of the Skies_. The airship is low enough that the elemental ring is nearly touching the ground, and a ladder is descending down from a door in the side.

> You see Jim's wife, Shiela, sitting outside a small tent at the base of the cliff right outside town, whittling and whistling to himself. He hears you approach and looks at the three of you confused for a second.
>
> **Shiela**: "What? Where's Mr. Jasper?"

> **Shiela**: "Sharn?? That's not good. The only way to Sharn is out of Newthrone."

> **Shiela:** "Listen, House Tharashk flew in last night. They think you killed that noble. Jim's trying to calm them down in the Pub right now. I think you better go talk to them."

#### Parley - Pub

> Two bugbears are lounging outside the pub, looking bored. One of them is tossing a vicious looking dagger up in the air, the other is carving something out of a block of wood. Both of them glance over your group but quickly dismiss you and go back to their boredom. A small clawfoot raptor is hitched outside the pub, frightening the horses nearby. A loud argument coming from inside the pub, and someone slams their hands down on a table.
>
> _"Those people are HEROES! They SAVED US!"_

> Jim is sitting at a table, flushed with anger, his wife trying to calm him down. Across from him is a tall human man, wearing well made clothing and a deep burgundy overcoat. On his shoulder is a bright green parrot, and his face has several deep scars. Standing around him is a half-orc and an ogre, dressed for sailing. Standing behind the man, hands clasped behind his back, is Ven Leser's former butler, [[Percy Graves]].

> The scarred man at the table turns to study you as you walk in. Percy bends down to whisper in his ear and you  the man nods.
>
> **Everest:**_"Well, well. It appears these... heroes... have come to us. Please, sit, let us chat."_

- **A House Tharashk Inquisitive named [[Everest Lindsey]]**
  - Believes NPCs killed his **idiot** nephew, Ven Leser

> **Everest:** "House Tharashk cannot appear weak in the face of an heir's death. I was sent to apprehend the so-called Heroes of Whitecliff that killed my nephew."
>
> **Jim**: "I told you, sir, the town will not allow this. You have no authority here."
>
> **Everest:** "Tharashk has a right to avenge a murder of their own, innkeeper."

> **Everest:** "I thought you might not be agreeable, so I took certain... steps... to ensure your cooperation."
>
> He pulls a ring off his finger and sets it on the table. The ring has eyes carved around its perimeter, and it begins to glow softly and then expands to about a 1 foot circle. The inside of the ring is like a window, and on the other side is a Conk, sitting against the wall in shackles.
>
> "I will let you settle your affairs here before I take you back. Please return to the pub at dawn."

> As you head out the door to the pub, you hear Everest call out after you.
> **Everest:**: "Heroes! Remember this! Everest Lindsey always gets his prey. ALWAYS."

#### Setback - Save Merigold - Skill Challenge? 3 good/3 bad

> The ladder to the airship has been retracted now but it is still hovering so that the ring is just above the ground. The fire elemental in the ring is causing it to glow with a flickering red light but the rest of the ship that you can see seems to be dark.

##### Success - Rescue Conk

##### Failure - Have to fight way off ship / captured by Everest?

Merigold comes in during the darkness and attacks the two bugbear guards

#### Conflict

- **2 bugbear hunters sneak aboard the boat and try to capture the PCs**
  - One is in the crows nest, one is under the bench

> A small [keelboat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/vehicles/keelboat) is moored to the middle pier. A single sail is furled on a middle mast, and a crows nest sits at the top. A platform with a helm raises up from the back of the deck. A short rope ladder is hung down over the side.

> As you head down the pier towards the boat, you hear behind you: "Heroes! I asked you politely to stay!" Turning around, Everest is standing at the edge of the dock, his parrot perched on his shoulder and Percy standing behind him. "But I prefer the joys of the hunt anyway! I wish you safe travels. The jungle can be...unforgiving."

**ROLL STEALTH FOR BOTH HERE** {dice: 1d20 + 5} {dice: 1d20 + 5}

> Climbing up onto the deck reveals a simple deck. Underneath the platform in the back are two cots and a low table. The helm rises out of the platform, and a ladder leads up to it. Two oars are laying on the deck, and a bench sits at the front of the boat with two oar holes on either side, close enough that one person could row. Off the front of the boat, an everbright lantern hangs from a hook.

> The current is strong enough that as soon as you cast off from the pier, you begin moving down the river. As you sail away from Whitecliff down the Adder River, you see Everest Lindsay walk down the dock towards the water. He stands there watching you, as the town recedes into the distance, then the river bends around a cliff and he's gone. Before long, the river swings to the west, heading into the jungle. The river widens and the current slows, and the ship slows with it. **GIVE ME A PERCEPTION CHECK**

- Bugbear hunters drop out of the rigging
