 # Cantrip Candle
 
 ### Description
 
 ```ad-item
 
 This scented candle, of a shape and color of a DM's choosing, exudes a strange smell that is familiar and pleasant, but you cannot place it.
 
 ```


 ### Use
 
 The candle has 4 sections. Using an action, you may light one section of the candle. Once lit, the section will burn for up to 1 hour. Each section of the candle may be extinguished like a normal candle and re-lit at a later time. At the end of the hour, the section is extinguished and cannot be recovered.
 
 The candle is associated with a spell from the sorcerer's cantrip list (see [here](https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:sorcerer=1)). Any person within 15 feet of the candle who is able to smell the scent it emits gains the ability to cast the cantrip associated with the candle for the duration. Persons who can already cast the cantrip can now do so as a bonus action. If, for any reason, the person can no longer smell the candle, they lose the ability to cast the cantrip.
 
 When casting the spell with the help of the candle, your spellcasting ability modifier is your proficiency bonus, and your spell save DC is 10 + your proficiency bonus.
