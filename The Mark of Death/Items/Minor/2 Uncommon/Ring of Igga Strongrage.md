This ring has 3 charges and regains all spent charges at dawn. While wearing the ring, you may use the charges to: 

- **1 Charge**: You may use an action to allow yourself or a creature you touch to spend one hit die and regain hit points as if it were a short rest.
- **+1 Charge**: You may target a creature within 60 feet.
- **+1 Charge**: You may use a bonus action instead of a full action.
